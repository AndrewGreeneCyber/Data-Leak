<h1>A Data Leak</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this incident, a sales manager gave their team access to a folder containing confidential files during a meeting. The folder included materials related to an unannounced product, customer analytics, and promotional content. The manager failed to revoke access after the meeting, and a sales team member mistakenly shared a link to the entire folder with a business partner, who then posted it on social media. The control issue identified was the lack of proper access restrictions. Recommendations include limiting access based on user roles and conducting regular audits of user privileges to prevent similar incidents. The security plan snapshot emphasizes the importance of data security and protections against data leaks, as outlined in NIST SP 800-53: AC-6.
